📈 Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model capable of forecasting gold prices by analyzing historical datasets. Leveraging the power of Random Forest Regression, the model provides reliable and accurate price predictions.

The focus was on delivering clean, insightful, and interpretable results through rigorous preprocessing, model optimization, and visualization techniques.

🔥 Key Responsibilities & Achievements
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and pre-processed over 10,000+ data points to ensure high-quality input for the model.

Model Implementation:
Implemented Random Forest Regression to predict gold prices, significantly optimizing performance by reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 15%.

Data Visualization:
Visualized important insights, trends, and model outputs using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better understanding and presentation.


📊 Output
Predicted gold prices plotted against actual values.

Visual interpretation of key features influencing gold prices.

Model evaluation metrics with a reduced MAE by 15%.
